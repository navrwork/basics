/**
 * <pre>
 * When defining subclasses for a sealed class in Java, each subclass must explicitly declare how it will continue the sealing initiated by its superclass. This is done using one of three modifiers: final, sealed, or non-sealed.
 * final:
 * This modifier prevents any further extension of the subclass. It effectively terminates the inheritance chain at this point.
 * sealed:
 * This modifier allows for controlled extension of the subclass, but only by explicitly permitted subclasses declared within its own permits clause. This maintains the restricted inheritance model of sealed classes.
 * non-sealed:
 * This modifier removes the sealing restriction from the subclass, allowing it to be extended by any other class, even those not known at compile time. This effectively reverts to traditional open inheritance for this branch of the hierarchy.
